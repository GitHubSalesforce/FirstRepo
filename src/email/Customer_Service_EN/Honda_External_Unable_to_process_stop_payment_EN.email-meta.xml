PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL

Good morning/afternoon, 

Thank you for your e-mail. 

Please be advised that due to its close proximity, we are unable to stop the (MM/DD/YYYY) payment. 

All subsequent payments however, have been stopped. 

To avoid an overpayment from occurring, the customer will be required to request a one-time stop payment at their bank. 

In the case that a stop payment cannot be made, thereby resulting in an overpayment, a full reimbursement will be issued to the customer pending clearance of the payout/overpayment (approximately 2 weeks). 

Should the customer wish to expedite the refund procedure, a bank statement showing the successful debit of the payout/overpayment can be provided to us via e-mail or fax. Once received and reviewed, a rush request will be processed to have the reimbursement issued to the customer within 72 business hours via an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).
