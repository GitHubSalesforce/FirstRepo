PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL

Good afternoon, 

Thank you for your e-mail. 

We have turned off your pre-authorized debit payments, effective today. Your next biweekly payment is (DATE). You can transfer funds to us using a bill payment through your bank, using HFS account number (HFS #) on a monthly basis. For months that have two payments, your total will be (AMOUNT) . However, there are months in the year that have 5 weeks, and you may have 3 payments, totaling (AMOUNT). You will need to keep track of this to ensure you are sending enough money. 

There are no extra charges for transferring the money to us monthly. The money would need to be received within 30 days of each biweekly payment. Do not go more than 30 days without sending us a payment, as this could lead to your credit being affected. Furthermore, you may receive automated collections calls if your account starts going towards 15 days with no payment. You can disregard these calls. 

Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reply to this email or contact us at 1-800-387-5399. Our hours of operation are Monday to Friday, 8:00am to 8:00pm EST.
