Good morning/afternoon, 

Thank you for your e-mail. 

Please be advised that in order to have a name removed or added to the loan, you will have to undergo a procedure referred to as a “lease/loan assumption&quot;. 

To initiate the procedure, the person wanting to take over the lease/loan will be required to visit a Honda/Acura dealership and complete a credit application. Once completed and approved, Honda Financial Services will forward the necessary paperwork over to the dealership which will be reviewed and completed by all parties involved. 

The completed paperwork will then be forwarded to Honda Financial Services to finalize the transfer. 

Please be advised that the associated fee for the procedure is $450.00 (plus taxes). The dealership may also charge additional administrative costs. 

For any additional information, please feel free to contact our Assumption Department by calling 1-800-387-5399; EXT: 7518. 

Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reply to this email or contact us at 1-800-387-5399. Our hours of operation are Monday to Friday, 8:00am to 8:00pm EST.
