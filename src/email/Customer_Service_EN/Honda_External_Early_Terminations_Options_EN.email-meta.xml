 	Early Terminations Options 

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL

Good morning/afternoon, 

Thank you for your e-mail. 

Please be advised of the following options: 

1. Lease/ Loan Assumption

If you wish to terminate your lease/Loan early, your best option would be to have your vehicle assumed by another individual. Once you have found an individual who is interested in taking over your lease/loan, they will be required to complete a credit application at any Honda/Acura dealership. Once approved, Honda Financial Services will send over the necessary paperwork to the dealership, which will then be reviewed and completed by both you and the individual taking over the lease/loan. Please be advised that there is an associated fee of $450 (plus applicable taxes). 

For specific inquiries regarding the assumption procedure, please feel free to contact our assumptions department by calling 1-800-387-5399; EXT: 7518. 

2. Voluntary Surrender (only applicable to lease vehicles) 

In this scenario, you would return the vehicle early and will still make the remaining payments. Prior to returning the vehicle, it must be inspected by Datascan. To set-up an appointment, you will be required to contact our Lease Maturity department by calling 1-800-387-5399; EXT: 7677. 

The remaining payments will have to be provided in certified funds to the Honda/Acura dealership where you will be returning your vehicle. 

3. Private Sale of the vehicle/Dealership Payout

Sell the vehicle privately or back to a dealership to payout the remaining balance owing on the loan. 

4. Voluntary Repossession

This option is available in the case that remaining payments cannot be made. By returning your vehicle and not making the remaining payments, the credit rating of all parties assigned to the contract will be negatively impacted. Prior to resorting to this option, we insist that you consider all of the above mentioned alternatives. You may also contact your local Honda/Acura dealership to explore further options. If you wish to precede with voluntary repossession, please contact our customer relations department by calling 1-800-387-5399; EXT: 7691. 

Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reply to this email or contact us at 1-800-387-5399. Our hours of operation are Monday to Friday, 8:00am to 8:00pm EST.
