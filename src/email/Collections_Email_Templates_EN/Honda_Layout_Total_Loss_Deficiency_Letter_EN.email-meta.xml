    <textOnly>Total Loss - Deficiency Letter 

 Dear xxxxxxx 

	By virtue of your Vehicle Conditional Sales Agreement dated xxxxxxx, your account is in default and your loan balance of $xxxx is now due in full.

	Numerous attempts to contact you in regards to this matter have been unsuccessful to resolve and we are not prepared to continue with this situation. Therefore, please consider this letter as a formal demand for the entire arrears balance to be received in certified funds at the address listed below no later than date.

	Please make payment payable to Honda Financial Services 
	180 Honda Blvd, Suite 200 
	Markham, Ontario
	L6C 0H9 

	Please include your full lease account number on the cheque.
	If this date of demand is not met, please be advised that we will be opening a file with our legal counsel (3rd party collection agency) for collection of the entire loan balance plus probable interest and costs. Such action will have a derogatory effect on your credit report for 7 years, which will negatively affect your ability to obtain credit in the future.

	Your prompt attention to this matter will save you considerable costs and inconvenience. Please ensure that you contact the undersigned before the deadline with details of the action you have taken to resolve this issue. 
	Yours Sincerely,
